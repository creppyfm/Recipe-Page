        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>If the first recipe you clicked on was my world-famous <a href="./ricebeans.html">Rice and Beans</a> recipe, you're not in luck.
            In face, I'm sorry to say that this recipe is probably just as bad (if not worse,) and I will again strongly advise against actually
            attempting to recreate this monstrosity of a dish.
        </p>
        <p>If you've just come from my moderately well-known <a href="./frypick.html">Fried Pickles</a> recipe, you're most-likely confused.
            How could such a fanstastic cook sink so low? Does an air fryer really make things <em>that much easier?</em> The answer to both questions
            is 19.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <p>Moving on, here's what you'll need:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Veggies, all of them. Buy all of the veggies.</li>
            <li>More veggies</li>
            <li>Sesame seeds</li>
            <li>Chicken</li>
            <li>Stir-Fry Sauce</li>
            <li>Some kind of oil. I don't think it's olive oil though. Oil != Olive Oil.</li>
            <li>Mushrooms</li>
            <li>The audacity</li>
            
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <p>How dare you?</p>

        <ol type="I">
            <li>Chop/skin/peel/shuck all of the veggies.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat the <em>not olive oil</em> in a large sautee pan over medium very high heat.</li>
            <li>Add some or all of the veggies when the pan is hot.</li>
            <li>Add the rest of the veggies if you only added some.</li>
            <li>Cook for like five minutes or until the veggies stop pleading for their lives.</li>
            <li>Add <strong>Stir-Fry Sauce</strong> and turn the heat down to low.</li>
            <li>Damn, we forgot to make like rice or noodles to serve this over. Do that now.</li>
            <li>Damn, we also forgot to do anything with the chicken, so now this is <em>Veggie</em> Stir-Fry.</li>
            <li>Eat it if you want. I might try it just to get out of work the next couple of days. YMMV.</li>
        </ol>
