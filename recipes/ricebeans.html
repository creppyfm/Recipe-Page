        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This rice and beans recipe is absolutely positively <strong><em>fantastic,</em></strong> provided you've never
        had rice and beans before. I am by no means a cook, so be warned: I'm trying. Not my best, but I'm trying.
        </p>

        <p>This recipe is a poor attempt to bring together the smokiness and heartiness we've all come to love in traditional
            rice and beans. If you're looking to make authentic rice and beans, keep looking. This recipe is for those
            who claim they want to make rice and beans, but really have no intention of doing so. 
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <p>Ok, so here's what you'll need:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Rice</li>
            <li>Beans</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>1 Large Onion</li>
            <li>Like 10 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>Some Scallions</li>
            <li>Too much Cumin</li>
            <li>Adobo</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Something to make the rice orange-ish</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <p>Oh boy, you're <em>actually</em> doing this?</p>

        <ol type="I">
            <li>Chop <strong>Onion</strong> and <strong>Garlic</strong> and <strong>Scallions</strong> into small bits, but not too small.</li>
            <li>Turn your burner on medium, and melt <strong>Butter</strong> in a large sautee pan.</li>
            <li>Add chopped veggies to sautee pan.</li>
            <li>Reevaluate your reasoning behind continuing.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, it would probably be a good idea to cook the rice.</li>
            <li>Once veggies are giving off that strong "I know what I'm doing" aroma, add beans to sautee pan.</li>
            <li>Suddenly remember that this recipe should for sure include some kind of <strong>Tomatoes</strong> lolol</li>
            <li>Add <strong>Cumin</strong>, <strong>Salt</strong>, <strong>Adobo</strong>, and <em>whatever makes the rice orange</em> to bean and veggie mixture.</li>
            <li>When rice is tender, add that too the sautee pan too, right? Done, I think.</li>
            <li>Enjoy?</li>
        </ol>
