        <h2 class="head2">Description</h2>

        <p>If you've never experienced the absolute pleasure of biting down into the crunchy, yet tender, <em>masterpiece</em> that is a fried pickle,
            then I'm honestly excited for you. I remember my first time, and I'm so thankful for that experience. Fried pickles just might be the best damn
            food on the whole damn planet. And I am damn good at making them.
        </p>
        <p>This recipe is simple (provided you have an air fryer,) and if followed correctly, will leave you with the best fried pickles you've ever
            tasted. The breading won't <em>fall off.</em> The pickles will be <em>tender.</em> The fat content will be <em>minimal.</em> Need I say more?
